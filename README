A quick and dirty sbt plugin that writes a simple .ensime file
==============================================================

Since sbt 0.10 did away with the lib_managed directory, ensime does no
longer know where to find library dependencies for a project, see
https://github.com/aemoncannon/ensime/issues/157 for the discussion.

While people work on a complete solution, this plugin allows to
quickly generate an .ensime file in the top project directory that
contains all the dependency jars in the :compile-jars variable. It
does not know anything about subprojects or any fancy things, but it
restores elementary ensime functionality.

How to use it
-------------

Clone this repository, and do a publish-local in sbt (or a + publish-local
to build for scala 2.8.1, 2.9.0-1 and 2.9.1). Then put the line

libraryDependencies += "de.hars" %% "ensime-plugin" % "0.2"

in your ~/.sbt/plugins/build.sbt. Then you can just say "ensime" at
the sbt prompt in an sbt project and it will write a new .ensime file.
It will overwrite an existing file, so if you have an existing project
with settings you want to keep, you should move the old file out of
the way and copy the old settings over.
